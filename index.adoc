== Addons
Addons for Dalek Mod are allowed, but we would like that any Addon follows these Guidelines and also these special cases: + 
- Your Addon should not use the **dalekmod** modid when registering stuff +
- If your addon is both client and server (**common**) please disable the DMU Button in the Titlescreen +
DM Assets and Data can be extracted from the .jar file or downloaded from here: https://jaysonjson.github.io/DMInternal/assets.zip

== TARDIS
.**Builder**
[%collapsible]
====
Dalek Mod 1.21.3 will use "_TARDIS Builders_", which handle how the TARDIS should be placed and destroyed in the world.
For example, during demat the TARDIS Builder will remove the TARDIS Blocks and during remat it will place the blocks again with the required data.

TARDIS Builders are not *Datapack* driven but done via *Java Code*. +

As of now Dalek Mod has 2 TARDIS Builder: +
- *DefaultTardisBuilder* (Places 3 Blocks: TARDIS, TARDIS_TOP, LIGHT) +
- *NoLightTardisBuilder* (Places 2 Blocks: TARDIS, TARDIS_TOP; Useful if your exterior does not have a lantern)

To create a custom TardisBuilder you need a class that extends *TardisBuilder*
[source,java]
----
public class MyTardisBuilder extends TardisBuilder {}
----
*TardisBuilder* is an *abstract* class that has the following functions declared: +
- *rematAction* +
- *dematAction* +
- *finishReMatAction* +
- *finishDeMatAction* +
- *setBlock* +
- *createTardis* +
- *buildTardis* +
- *destroyTardis* +
- *constructTardis* +

*rematAction* and *dematAction* get called during remat/demat, their *finish actions* get called once the animation is done. *setBlock* is a helper function that places a block in the world and updates it. *createTardis* is already defined, it calls *constructTardis* and then creates a new *TardisData* and its regarding *TardisId*. *buildTardis* is also already defined and will rebuild the TARDIS in the World with the existing TardisData. *destroyTardis* and *constructTardis* will place or destroy the TARDIS related blocks in the world but not do anything with data.
In further, you can check our custom TARDIS Builders how they work code-wise, it is not rocket science and a simple system.

TARDIS Builders can be registered using a custom Fabric Registry
[source,java]
----
Registry.register(DMRegistry.TARDIS_BUILDERS, ¬ID¬, ¬builder¬);
----
====
.**Exterior**
[%collapsible]
====
Exteriors are done using *Datapacks* and *Resourcepacks*. +

.Datapack Side - Server
[%collapsible]
=====
Datapacks are only for the server, so this does not require much data to work with. +
The Server only needs to know which TARDIS Exteriors exist, so the jsons will only be an array of data. +
The jsons for exteriors are located inside *data/your_namespace/tardis/exterior/* and will look like this: +
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "id": "dalekmod:test",
    "builder": "dalekmod:default"
  },
  {
    "id": "dalekmod:corrupted",
    "builder": "dalekmod:default"
  }
]
----
ID and Builder is technically self-explanitory, but *id* will be the exteriors id and *builder* will be the builder it uses. +
You can have multiple jsons as you like with different data, if you want to organize your exteriors a bit - it does not matter since all jsons inside this folder will be loaded if valid. +
=====
.Resourcepack Side - Client
[%collapsible]
=====
Now the Client needs to know which Models and Textures it needs to render - thats where Resourcepacks come into play. +
It can be internally in the mod or an extern resourcepack. +
The jsons for exteriors are like for Datapacks located inside *assets/your_namespace/tardis/exterior/* +
[source,json]
----
{
  "id": "dalekmod:test",
  "name": "Test",
  "description": "Test",
  "model": "dalekmod:geo/block_entity/tardis_exterior/canon/1963_police_box/1963_police_box.geo.json",
  "animation": "",
  "texture": "dalekmod:textures/block_entity/tardis_exterior/canon/1963_police_box/1963_police_box.png",
  "layers": {
    "snow_map": "dalekmod:textures/block/1963_police_box_snowmap.png",
    "light_map": "dalekmod:textures/block_entity/tardis_exterior/canon/1963_police_box/1963_police_box_lightmap.png"
  }
}
----
This is an example exterior json. +
Every json entry is self-explanitory again, but I will talk a bit more about the *layers*: +
Layers are what the *snowmaps* used to be in Dalek Mod 1.16.5 and you can add it using the Layers ID and then a path to the texture. +
Dalek Mod 1.21.3+ has these default Render Layers: +
- *snow_map* +
- *light_map* +
- *cherry_map* +
- *sculk_map* +
- *ash_map* +

Custom Layers can be added in *code* by using the *TardisRenderLayerCallback* event which invokes inside the TardisRenderer constructor. +
Something which is TODO is a System that allows to override the layer array from existing exteriors. +
Reason for that is, if you have 2 addons that add new layers and both want to add them to default exteriors, one will override the other one. +
You can do it via code by getting the *ClientTardisExterior* class from the *TardisExterior Registry* using its ID and add the layer, but I will also add an option to do it via resourcepacks.
=====
.Server-Client mismatch
[%collapsible]
=====
When a Player joins, the Server will send all of its Exteriors to the Client, if the Client is missing an Exterior, it will render the "_Corrupted TARDIS Exterior_". +
If you don't know how to make a mod and result to a Server Datapack and Resourcepack, the Clients will _need_ your Resourcepack in order to Render the TARDIS Exterior, otherwise its an ID Mismatch.

== Sonics

== Styling
.**General style rules**
[%collapsible]
====
Almost all assets should follow the Jappa art style and the Minecraft style as a whole (Exceptions covered later).
An overview of what that entails can be found at https://www.blockbench.net/wiki/guides/minecraft-style-guide/. +
====
.**Consistency**
[%collapsible]
====
Everything added in the mod should be consistent with everything else in the mod.
When making an asset, try to base the asset on similar existing assets in the mod, or in vanilla Minecraft *if there are none in the mod*.
If there is nothing similar in either the mod or the base game, then and *only* then can the asset be created completely from scratch (still ensuring to remain within the general confines set by other assets). +

If making a new asset which is in a new art style, either the added asset should be adapted to better fit the style, or *all* previous assets should be updated to the new style. +
====
.**Exceptions**
[%collapsible]
====
The style rules highlighted in this document can be broken for only a select few reasons. +
- If an asset is supposed to be an asset ripped directly from an earlier version of the mod, this can be included in its original state (possibly with small modifications like file format etc.) so long as the asset is clearly labelled as such in game. +
- If the source an asset is trying to emulate has an extremely *important* recognisable feature which cannot be replicated within the art style, some rules may be bent slightly to allow for this feature to be present. +

Note: in cases where stretching the art style introduces a new way of representing features on previous assets, said previous assets should be updated to match the new style. +
====
== Sound
.**General sound rules**
[%collapsible]
====
Every sound should be mastered such that its volume is relative to other existing sounds of the same type.
This includes both in-game sound effects and all music. +
All sound files should be stored in the .ogg format. +
====
.**Music**
[%collapsible]
====
There are two types of music used in the mod.
One is title screen music, the other is ambient, in-game music. +

.**Title screen tracks**
[%collapsible]
=====
Title screen tracks have fewer rules.
These will usaully be arrangements of the Doctor Who theme, but other themes (perhaps themes from various Doctor Who spin-offs) may be included as well.
These will usually be *upbeat* (especially compared to the ambient tracks) and are free in their intrumentation. +
=====
.**Ambient tracks**
[%collapsible]
=====
Ambient tracks should be mostly consistent in both *feel* (to use a rather vague term) and *intrumentation* relative to other ambient tracks from the same dimension.
Having said that, each track should be distinct enough from one another that it is possible to recognise which one is which when playing in game. +
These are, as the name implies, *ambient*, and should not distract the player from what they're doing, but rather enhance it.
The vanilla tracks create a sense of importance to moments that would otherwise be dull, making said moments more memorable; we should be striving to achieve the same affect.
=====
====
== Structures
.**TARDIS Interior**
[%collapsible]
====
When designing a TARDIS interior to use in an addon, you should respect the limitations put in place. All interiors in the mod fit within a 64x64 area, equivalent to 4x4 chunks. +

image::images/TARDIS Building Area.png[alt="X Axis: Red | Z Axis: Blue", width=50%, height=50%]
Red is the X Axis, while Blue denote the Z Axis. Each square is a chunk. +

If designing a canon interior (one that has been in the show), you should aim to keep the styling consistent with the other canon interiors already in the mod. +

If designing a custom interior, then you have free rein. It can be as expensive as you want, but it has to be obtainable in survival. This means no player heads or bedrock-equivalent blocks. +
====
.**Generated Structures**
[%collapsible]
====
When designing a structure to spawn in dimensions, try and keep it within a chunk. There will be some exceptions, such as boss arenas or dungeons. +

Simple structures, such as Thal houses (from 1.16), should aim to utilise the block palette of the area it will be generating in. +

Larger structures may utilise a wider variety, but not go over the top. The structures should not become a resource farm (Dungeons are the exception). +

If you have to use rare blocks, use them in moderation, don't allow it to become the focus of the structure. +
